# Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence MA030706 (Term 3)

## Course Description

Developing reliable, secure, and robust machine learning models represents a central challenge in artificial intelligence and holds fundamental importance. This course aims to provide a solid understanding of the mathematical foundations of this rapidly evolving field while also exposing students to cutting-edge research and advancements. To enhance learning and foster practical skills, the course features a group project where students design and implement a system applying the concepts and techniques covered in the curriculum.

Lead Instructor: Dr. Oleg Y. Rogov, PhD.
